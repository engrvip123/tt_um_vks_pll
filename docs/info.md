## How it works

A PFD circuit is a phase frequency detector circuit, which is used to measure the phase and frequency difference between two input signals. A PFD circuit is often a part of a phase-locked loop (PLL), which is a feedback system that synchronizes the output signal of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with a reference signal. A PFD circuit can be implemented using different logic gates, such as NAND, NOR, or AND gates. A common PFD circuit consists of two edge-triggered D flip-flops and a NAND gate in the reset path.

## How to test

## External hardware

Requires function generator and oscilloscope for measurements. No other h/w required.
